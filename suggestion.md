## Suggestions

* Rename the repo to a more generic name, e.g. Clubhouse_Topics
  * The current name has a Year/Month in it, which implies that:
    * You have to create a new repo every month, or
    * Rename the current one. Neither is very desirable from SEO (Search Engine Optimization) point of view
* Under this repo, you may create many folders, e.g. Economics, Social, History, etc.
  * People are encouraged to check in proposals in the appropriate folder
* You may also create a file that is named by date, e.g. Clubhouse_2023_11_11, which contains the link to the Clubhouse Room, as well as agenda items.
